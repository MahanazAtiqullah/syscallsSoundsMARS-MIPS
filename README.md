# syscallsSoundsMARS-MIPS
This is what I used to test the different syscall sounds in MARS so I could select which ones to use for my Computer Architecture project with professor Nhut Nguyen at UTDallas. This repository does NOT give students any resources to copy or cheat on their final project. It simply makes it easier to test syscall sounds to help them pick out which one they would like to use if they choose to do so. Using syscall sounds is NOT a mandatory part of the project.
I posted here on GitHub so my classmates could benefit from it too.

Test the different sound options available in MARS MIPS for syscall 31 or 33. Simply type the name of the label of the segment you want to hear in the jal line in the main function.
